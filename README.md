Bootcamp - Phase 1 - Week 5 Homework

Utilized basic template and a few predefined CSS assets to implement moment.JS and bootstrap to create a daily assignments application while integrating local storage.

Made a basic layout for a time slot utilizing HTML and used javascript to loop for a work day. Integrated save buttons to save information in the input sections to local storage and repopulate on page load. Used some slight editing using bootstrap to imitate an example layout.
